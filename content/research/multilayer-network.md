**Multilayer network centrality measures to identify known and novel regulators of tissue-tissue communication**
===========
* * *
### We are interested in understanding the multi-tissue communication. The project involves identifying genes that regulate multi-tissue interaction. Recent studies have shown that mainly hormone-secreting genes are involved in inter-tissue communication. We model the multi-tissue data as a multilayer network and propose a set of centrality measures that are tailored for the multilayer setting. Our current effort is to validate our methods on synthetic and real-world biological systems ###
