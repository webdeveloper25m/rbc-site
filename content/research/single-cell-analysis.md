# **Single cell analysis for understanding infection in macrophages** #

### Single cell experiments were carried out to see what morphological features help or inhibit infection of cells. The data contains cell features along with lysosome and bacterial intensities for single cells after infection. Further, different genes were silenced to study their effects on infection. ###
