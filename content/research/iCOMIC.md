**iCOMIC: a graphical interface-driven pipeline for cancer genome data analysis workflows**,
The rapid advancement in next-generation technology.

### The rapid advancement in next-generation technology has made a tremendous impact on genome-based research. Analysis of the large amount of data generated can be tricky as it demands expertise in bioinformatics and computer terminal commands. Even though many softwareâ€™s are available for genomic data analysis, a comprehensive toolkit incorporating a considerable number of tools is missing. In order to tackle this problem to an extent, we are developing iCOMIC with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface incorporating multiple pipelines for whole genome/exome sequencing and RNA-Seq data analysis. The tools are connected together using the workflow manager Snakemake and the GUI framework is built using PyQt5, python binding of Qt. iCOMIC serves as a platform to analyze genomic data for researchers with minimal programming skills and as a tool to perform analysis incorporating advanced parameters for expert bioinformaticians. The tool is more like a point click application where the user can input raw sequencing data, choose the tools of interest, set the parameters and will get back annotated vcf files in case of WGS/WES pipelines and list of differentially expressed genes in case of RNA-Seq data. Finally, we will be integrating machine learning models to predict cancer driver genes. ###
